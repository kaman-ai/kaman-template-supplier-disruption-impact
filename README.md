# Supplier Disruption Impact Analyst

The app of the **Supplier Disruption Impact Analyst** template in the Kaman marketplace.

When a supplier or site goes down, walks the supply graph to every part, product and customer order that depends on it, checks stock cover in parallel, quantifies days short and revenue at risk, and raises the mitigation a planner approves. Connect your supply chain systems and planning channel at install.

It is installed as a code project of yours when you install the template,
and it is a thin layer: the work is done by the template's agents and
workflow, on your own systems through the connections you chose at install.

## How it is wired

`kaman.app.json` names the agents and workflow the app uses, and the
actions it offers. The ids in this repository are the template's own.
**Install rewrites the file**: each id becomes the id of your installed
copy. Nothing else is rewritten.

The app talks to Kaman only from its server route (`app/api/action/[id]`),
through `@yoctotta/kaman-sdk/app`, with `KAMAN_BASE_URL` and
`KAMAN_API_KEY` — which a Kaman preview injects. The key never reaches the
browser.

## Publishing a new version

Push here, then republish the template pinned to the new commit. Installs
always take the pinned commit, never the tip of `main`.
